# **Temporal and spatial analysis of earthquakes in Italy in the last century**

Italy lies at the boundary of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, and both plates move and smash into each other releasing a lot of energy and making Italy a seismically active zone, especially central Italy. In order to better study the relationship between the occurrence of earthquakes and the geological structure, we will present the temporal and spatial characteristics of earthquakes, explore the temporal and spatial rules of earthquake disasters and determine the seismically active regions in Italy.
We will investigate and analyze the earthquakes data coming from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program with the magnitude greater than MW 4.5 that occurred in Italy during the last hundred years: from 1921 to 2021.
